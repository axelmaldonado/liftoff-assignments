## Submission Instructions

### Overview

The app is a job board for Kansas City tech jobs. The idea came from looking at the current jobs boards and thinking on how they can be improved. For example, Startland News has a job board, but it has jobs from all sectors. It also has to be updated manually. ChuteKC is another local tech job board, but you must pay to post your job. This greatly limits the amount of jobs that actually get posted. KCTechJobs is limited to the kansas city area and is limited to only tech jobs. It uses the Indeed API to query for jobs based on paremeters such as job title, zip code, full time, etc.

Users who will find it useful include people looking to change job, or people who are thinking of moving to Kansas City and want to know about what opportunities are here.

### Features
Include Features here

User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

User Bio: Users can write persistent bios that other users can view.

Company Logo: Indeed's API doesn't provide a company logo, so a separate API is used to fetch the logo (clearbit.com)
